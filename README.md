## 🚀 Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces

Since you are running this in the cloud, you don't need to install anything locally!

1.  **Push this code to GitHub**:
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    # Add your remote origin
    # git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    # git push -u origin main
    ```

2.  **Open in Codespaces**:
    - Go to your GitHub repository.
    - Click the green **Code** button.
    - Select the **Codespaces** tab.
    - Click **Create codespace on main**.

3.  **Run the App**:
    - Codespaces will automatically install dependencies (this may take a minute).
    - Once ready, the terminal will open. Run:

      ```
    - A popup will appear to "Open in Browser". Click it to see your app!
